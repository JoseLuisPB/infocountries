# Infocountries

This is my first angular project, the purpose of this project is to get familiar with angular framework, some of the most libraries / frameworks used with angular and finally how to use an API to consume information.

These are the versions of the most important libraries and frameworks I have used:
  - Angular: 12.2.0
  - Angular-materials: 12.2.10
  - Bootstrap: 5.1.1
  - Ng2-charts: 2.4.3
